1. Usage

	To make a simple exchange you do:
	
		$exchange->change_from("eur")->change_to("usd")->exchange(); 
	
	This will return an array which looks like this:
	(
	'amount' => 1 (default)
	'from_currency' => "Euro"
	'rate' => 1.40700
	'to_currency' => "U.S. dollars"
	)
	
	Defined amount exchange:
		
		$exchange->change_from("eur")->change_to("usd")->amount(100)->exchange(); 
		
	This will return an array which looks like this:
	(
	'amount' => 100
	'from_currency' => "Euro"
	'rate' => 140.7
	'to_currency' => "U.S. dollars"
	)
	
	Defined return type:
	
		$exchange->change_from("eur")->change_to("usd")->exchange("rate");
		
	This will return a string containing the rate.
	
	Return JSON object:
	
		$exchange->change_from("eur")->change_to("usd")->exchange_json();
		
	This will return the same data as if the exchange() method was used, but will be returned in a JSON object instead of an array.
	
	Render <select> elements containing the currencies as options:
	
		$exchange->render_options($data);
		
	This will return a select element with currencies as options. $data is optional and if used it could contain a string like: 'id="from"' which 	would then give the select element an id of "from".

	"Invalid to exchange..." = As above but rather than change_from method it is the change_to method that passed an unsupported currency.

		exchange("from_currency") => Returns string containing the change from currencies name. Example : Euro
		exchange("rate") => Returns string containing the rate. Example: 1.40700
